🔧 Detailed Module Breakdown
1. 🧠 Encoder
Shared between query and support.

Hybrid CNN-ViT:

ResNet-50 for local features,

ViT block for capturing global structure of tumor regions.

Maintains low parameter count by using ViT only after ResNet Stage 3.

2. 🔁 Prototype Generator (Novel Contribution #1)
Standard PANet: masks support feature maps and averages to make class prototype.

New Idea: Instead of equal averaging, we:

Use a tiny attention network to weight pixels inside the mask,

Pool features by attention to get more informative prototypes.

Why? Tumor regions are heterogeneous, not all pixels equally informative.

3. 🧠 Cross-Attention Fusion (Novel Contribution #2)
Between query features and prototype:

Multi-head attention: each head learns alignment pattern between query tokens and prototype.

Helps learn fine-grained context even with noisy prototypes.

Output = enriched query features more aligned with the support class.

4. 🧪 Decoder with Consistency Regularization (Novel Contribution #3)
Decoder upsamples + fuses with multi-scale encoder features (like UNet++).

Adds Consistency Decoder Branch:

Given the query image and prototype, predict the support mask again (in reverse).

Regularize the main output with a cross-task consistency loss.

Idea: If prototype is good, both directions (support→query, query→support) should agree.

Where:

PrototypeContrastLoss separates positive vs negative support classes in feature space.

QueryConsistencyLoss aligns the query output with reversed support mask prediction.

🧪 Few-Shot Setup
N-way K-shot episodic training across patients.

Simulate:

1-way 1-shot

2-way 5-shot

3-way 1-shot

For each episode:

Sample support images (K) with masks.

Sample query image from unseen patient.

Predict query segmentation using support class prototypes.

🔬 Evaluation Metrics
Dice Score

IoU

Prototype Quality Score (intra-class compactness vs inter-class separation)

Generalization Score: performance drop from seen to unseen classes
